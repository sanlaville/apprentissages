Add a comment in .vimrc?
------------------------
"This is a comment in vimrc. It does not have a closing quote 

Execute the current open file?
------------------------------
:source %



Repeat the last command?
------------------------
The "." command repeats the last change made in normal mode. For example, if you press dw to delete a word, you can then press . to delete another word (. is dot, aka period or full stop).

The "@:" command repeats the last command-line change (a command invoked with ":", for example :s/old/new/).

- Repeat a previous command (not the last)?
-------------------------------------------

Moving lines up or down?
------------------------
You can move a line, or a block of lines, with the :m command. Examples:

:m 12	move current line to after line 12
:m 0	move current line to before first line
:m $	move current line to after last line
:m 'a	move current line to after line with mark a (see using marks)
:m 'a-1	move current line to before line with mark a
:m '}-1	move current line to the end of the current paragraph
For clarity, a space is shown after the :m commands above, but that space is not required.

To move a block of lines, use the same command but visually select the lines before entering the move command. You can also use arbitrary ranges with the move command. Examples:

:5,7m 21	move lines 5, 6 and 7 to after line 21
:5,7m 0	move lines 5, 6 and 7 to before first line
:5,7m $	move lines 5, 6 and 7 to after last line
:.,.+4m 21	move 5 lines starting at current line to after line 21
:,+4m14	same (. for current line is assumed)
